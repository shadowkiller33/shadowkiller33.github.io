# About Me

<img src="ww.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Lingfeng Shen (沈凌峰)**.<br>

I am a research scientist at Seed LLM department (Bytedance). I'm currently working on the agentic foundation models. Also, I consider myself a professional trader in options strategies and risk hedging.

During my time at Johns Hopkins, I worked with [Daniel Khashabi](https://danielkhashabi.com/) and [Philipp Koehn](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~phi/). Besides, I was fortunate to spend my last year of undergraduate at Tencent AI Lab, mentored by Haiyun Jiang, Lemao Liu and Shuming Shi.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and academic collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at — **lshen30[at]jh.edu** or **lingfeng.shen[at]bytedance.com**
