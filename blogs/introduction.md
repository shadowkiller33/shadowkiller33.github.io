## Introduction

This space is where I share my **market insights and trading thoughts**—from options structures like spreads and flies, to volatility regimes, risk management practices, and the psychology of positioning.  

I aim to write in a way that is **clear, structured, and practical**:  
- breaking down complex market moves into simple narratives,  
- recording the reasoning behind trades, not just the outcomes,  
- and reflecting on lessons learned from both successes and mistakes.  

Please note:  
- A **basic understanding of options** will help you follow along more easily.  
- If you’re new to derivatives, I recommend starting with some classic books:  
  - *Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives* — John C. Hull  
  - *Options Volatility & Pricing* — Sheldon Natenberg  
  - *Dynamic Hedging* — Nassim Nicholas Taleb  
  - *Trading Volatility* — Euan Sinclair  

If you’re curious about how I approach **options markets and trading discipline**, I hope these notes will resonate and perhaps spark ideas for your own journey.
