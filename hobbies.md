# Hobbies

## Motorsports & Formula 1

Motorsports ignite my passion, especially Formula 1. I’m deeply devoted to the [Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team](https://www.mercedesamgf1.com/). I admire young and talented racing drivers (and yes, good-looking too!) such as George Russell, Charles Leclerc, and Oscar Piastri — all of them true triple-jump drivers.

## NBA Basketball

The NBA holds a special place in my heart. I used to be a big fan of the Houston Rockets. The fast-paced nature of the game and the incredible skill of the players make every match worth watching. To be frank, I don’t have a favorite player in mind now; instead, I appreciate those who embody courage and fighting spirit.

## Video Games

When I’m not racing or watching sports, I enjoy playing video games. Over the years I’ve played a wide range of titles, and I believe there’s always some game we can share in common.

## Professional Trading

Beyond my research work, I also engage in professional trading with a focus on options strategies and risk hedging. The financial markets bring their own kind of excitement and challenge. For me, trading keeps my mind sharp and offers a fresh perspective on problem-solving.
